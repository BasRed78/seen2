# Seen vs Therapy: Positioning & Differentiation

## The Core Distinction

| Seen | Therapy |
|------|---------|
| Notice patterns | Change patterns |
| "What am I doing?" | "How do I stop?" |
| Self-guided awareness | Professional accountability |
| Daily mirror | Treatment plan |
| Shows you what's happening | Helps you change it |
| Reflects patterns | Processes root causes |
| Tracks | Treats |
| "I notice I did X when Y" | "Let's work on why Y triggers you" |

**Seen = mirror. Always.**

A mirror doesn't become a doctor just because you use it while recovering from surgery. It's still just showing you what's there.

## Key Reframe: Seen Isn't Pre-Therapy

Seen isn't a stepping stone *to* therapy. It's a lifelong awareness companion that adapts to wherever you are.

**Stages of Seen:**

| Stage | User mindset | Seen's role |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Discovery | "Something's off but I can't name it" | Help them see the pattern |
| Clarity | "I see what I'm doing" | Deepen understanding, explore triggers/function |
| Decision | "Do I want to change this?" | Support the weighing, no pressure |
| Active change | "I'm working on it (with therapist or solo)" | Track progress, catch setbacks, maintain awareness |
| Maintenance | "I've changed, but I want to stay aware" | Ongoing practice, prevent relapse |

**Therapy is one chapter some people add. Seen is the through-line.**

## Three Guardrails

1. **Legal** - Can't practice therapy without accreditation. Seen stays in awareness lane.
2. **Relationship** - Therapists as partners, not competitors
3. **Positioning** - Users understand what they're getting (and not getting)

## Narrative for Users

> "Seen helps you see what's happening. Not fix it, not judge it - just see it. 
>
> Most people know something's off but can't name it. We help you name it. 
>
> What you do with that awareness is up to you. Some people find that seeing is enough. Others take what they've learned to a therapist. Either way, you can't change what you can't see."

## Narrative for Therapists

### What excites them (lead with this):

> "Imagine your clients arriving with a week of pattern data. They've already noticed what triggers them, when it happens, how it shows up in their body. They have language for it. 
>
> Your session becomes deeper, faster - you're not spending 20 minutes figuring out what happened, you're working with someone who already sees themselves."

> "Seen keeps awareness alive between sessions. It's a daily practice - 5 minutes of honest reflection. When your client leaves your office, they don't go dark for a week. They stay in the work."

> "And after therapy? Seen is maintenance. The awareness muscle they built with you - we help them keep using it."

### The full picture:

> "Seen isn't a funnel to your door. It's a tool your clients can use before they meet you, while they work with you, and after they graduate. 
>
> You get a client who's already practicing awareness. And when your work together ends, they don't lose the habit - Seen keeps it alive."

### Address concerns (briefly, after excitement):

> "We stay in awareness. We don't diagnose, we don't treat, we don't give advice. When someone needs more than seeing, we point them to people like you."

## The Line Stays Clean

Seen during therapy isn't *doing* therapy. It's giving the client (and therapist) better data about what's happening in the other 167 hours of the week.

## Usage Duration Thinking

**Rough phases (pre-therapy or standalone):**

| Weeks 1-2 | Getting comfortable, learning the rhythm |
| Weeks 3-4 | Patterns start emerging, connections forming |
| Weeks 5-8 | Deeper clarity, triggers and functions become visible |
| Weeks 8-12+ | Either ready to act (therapy or self-directed change) OR patterns are complex enough to keep exploring |

**Key insight:** Seen isn't something people "graduate" from. Ongoing pattern awareness is valuable even if they never go to therapy - like a mindfulness practice they keep doing.
